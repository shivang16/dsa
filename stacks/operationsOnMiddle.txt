We will use a standard stack to store half of the elements and the other half of the elements which were added recently will be present in the deque. Insert operation on myStack will add an element into the back of the deque. The number of elements in the deque stays 1 more or equal to that in the stack, however, whenever the number of elements present in the deque exceeds the number of elements in the stack by more than 1 we pop an element from the front of the deque and push it into the stack. The pop operation on myStack will remove an element from the back of the deque. If after the pop operation, the size of the deque is less than the size of the stack, we pop an element from the top of the stack and insert it back into the front of the deque so that size of the deque is not less than the stack. We will see that the middle element is always the front element of the deque. So deleting of the middle element can be done in O(1) if we just pop the element from the front of the deque.
